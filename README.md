# Multivariate Statistics University Projects

This repository contains projects related to multivariate statistics completed as part of university coursework. Each project explores the application of statistical techniques to real-world datasets, providing valuable insights into data analysis and interpretation. Below, you'll find summaries of each project along with instructions on how to explore them.

## TP1: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) - One Factor
Explore the distribution of lead concentration across four substances using one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Key steps include:

- **Variable Description**: Understand the variable "Lead" in relation to the type of product.
- **Preliminary Tests**: Verify ANOVA assumptions through preliminary tests.
- **ANOVA Testing**: Examine if there's a significant difference in lead concentration among the four substances.
- **Residual Analysis**: Validate ANOVA results through a meticulous analysis of residuals.
- **Bonferroni Correction**: Identify the substance with the highest lead concentration using Bonferroni correction.

## TP2: Two-Factor Analysis of Variance
### Exercise 1:
Evaluate responses to three treatments at two different doses each. Key objectives include:

- **Variable Analysis**: Describe the "Response" variable and assess its normality.
- **Dose-Response Relationship**: Investigate the relationship between "Response" and preparations at different doses.
- **Average Response**: Calculate average responses for each treatment and draw meaningful conclusions.
- **Mode 1 Analysis**: Analyze the effect of the preparation on the response without considering the dose.
- **Mode 2 Analysis**: Test the effects of treatment, dose, and their interaction.
- **Subgroup Analysis**: Conduct subgroup analysis based on the dose, determining the most effective treatment using pairwise t-tests with Bonferroni correction.
- **ANCOVA**: Perform an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) considering patient age as a covariate.

## TP3: Binary Logistic Regression
Apply binary logistic regression to the "birthwt" dataset, aiming to identify risk factors associated with low birth weight. Tasks include:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Transform variables for regression analysis.
- **Dataset Partitioning**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Regression Modeling**: Apply logistic regression with model selection using AIC and stepwise methods.
- **Influential Values**: Identify influential values and determine significant variables affecting low birth weight.
- **Odds Ratios and Confidence Intervals**: Calculate odds ratios and their confidence intervals.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assess predictive performance using the "blorr" package.
